My attempts made for the  <a href="https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/NkaC7knWtjSbi6aYv/Data-Analytics?ref=DsEXFixxovqkRxR2u">Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program on Forage</a>.

# Problem Statement
Quantium has had a data partnership with a large supermarket brand for the last few years who provide transactional and customer data. Supermarket will regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. This is to satisfy their customerâ€™s changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalise on new opportunities. The Quantium analytics team are engaged in these processes to evaluate and analyse the performance of change and recommend whether it has been successful.

# Objectives
* Look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables.
* Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights found.
* Define your recommendation from your insights, determine which segments we should be targeting.

# Results
1. Most of the brands from the datasets are from The Smith's Snackfood Company Pty Ltd.
2. Sales are coming mainly from Budget - older families, Mainstream - young singles/couples, and Mainstream - retirees.
3. Mainstream midage and young singles and couples are more willing to pay more per packet of chips compared to their budget and premium counterparts.
4. There are more Mainstream - young singles/couples and Mainstream - retirees who buy chips. This contributes to there being more sales to these customer segments but this is not a major driver for the Budget - Older families segment. Higher sales may also be driven by more units of chips being bought per customer.
