# Objectives
* Look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables.
* Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights found.
* Define your recommendation from your insights, determine which segments we should be targeting.

# Results
1. Most of the brands from the datasets are from The Smith's Snackfood Company Pty Ltd.
2. Sales are coming mainly from Budget - older families, Mainstream - young singles/couples, and Mainstream - retirees.
3. Mainstream midage and young singles and couples are more willing to pay more per packet of chips compared to their budget and premium counterparts.
4. There are more Mainstream - young singles/couples and Mainstream - retirees who buy chips. This contributes to there being more sales to these customer segments but this is not a major driver for the Budget - Older families segment. Higher sales may also be driven by more units of chips being bought per customer.
